The goal of this project was to create a simple implementation of rock-paper-scissors in the browser console. Later, this project will have its own front-end.

Skills strengthened/demonstrated:
-demonstrated an ability to create functions, if-else statements, and while loops in Javascript
-demonstrated an understanding of how to assign/update values to variables, use comparison operators for comparing values, use logical operators in conditional statements, use methods, how to create nested code, and how to display information in the console.

Areas to improve:
-gain an intuitive understanding of mathematical methods Math.floor and Math.random and how to use them (as well as other methods)
